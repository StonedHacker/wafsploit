#wafsploit

## Introduction

Wafsploit is an advanced standalone WAF (Web Application Firewall) analysis and exploitation tool.
Its aim is to provide the security community with a tool that targets security bypass issues that affect WAFs in general rather than focusing on particular vendors and their WAF products. The tester can run automated testing modes or use manual testing features of wafploit to identify attack payloads that are not blocked by the WAF or potential vulnerabilities that the WAF may introduce.
